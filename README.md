###Weekly progress checklist for review

• How has each team member performed against their goal set last week?

• Have you set a goal for each team member for this week?

• Do any team members need more help to complete their assigned task(s)?

• Have you updated the task list on Github this week?

• Are all relevant code, bot photos and design files on the team Github?

• Have you noted which members attended labs and team meetings?

• Have team members shared their draft report sections (if the team decided they wanted to do that)?

• Are there any tasks that need to be done for progress to be made that have NOT been assigned to a team member?
