###Weekly progress checklist for review

â€¢ How has each team member performed against their goal set last week?

â€¢ Have you set a goal for each team member for this week?

â€¢ Do any team members need more help to complete their assigned task(s)?

â€¢ Have you updated the task list on Github this week?

â€¢ Are all relevant code, bot photos and design files on the team Github?

â€¢ Have you noted which members attended labs and team meetings?

â€¢ Have team members shared their draft report sections (if the team decided they wanted to do that)?

â€¢ Are there any tasks that need to be done for progress to be made that have NOT been assigned to a team member?
